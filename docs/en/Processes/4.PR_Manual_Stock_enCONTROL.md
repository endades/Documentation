# enCONTROL Stock Control System

---

## 1. Purpose

This manual is intended for new users of the stock control system used by Endades and their Customers. Its main objective is to provide a step-by-step guide for efficiently managing projects — from creating purchase orders to optimizing production processes in enCONTROL and enSITE. The document covers the key operations and is organized sequentially for easy reference.

---

## 2. Receiving materials
### 2.1 Receiving with enSITE

- Once a purchase order has been created, in ENBLAU go to **Warehouses** and open **"Pending to Receive"**. A tab will open showing all materials pending receipt for each project.

![pendientes_recibir](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/pendiente_recibir.jpg)
![pendientes_recibir](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/pendiente_recibir2.jpg)

> **Note:** For more details about purchase orders, see: [2.1. Purchase orders](3.PR_Manual_Stock_ENBLAU.md#21-pedidos-de-compra)

- Receiving mode: open **enSITE** from the workshop over Wi‑Fi with the person in charge of receiving the order.
- In **Order reception**, find the corresponding order (sorted by date).

![recepcion_pedido](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/recepcion_pedido.jpg)
![recepcion_pedido](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/recepcion_pedido2.jpg)

- Register the receipt by creating a **New Delivery Note** from the **Warehouse** section.

![albaran](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/albaran.jpg)
![albaran](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/albaran2.jpg)
![albaran](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/albaran3.jpg)

- In ENBLAU the **Pending to receive** tab under **Warehouses** will synchronize and the materials for that order will no longer appear there.
- In **Purchase Order** you can check traceability.
- In **enSITE**, indicate the quantities received and the location where they will be stored (Warehouse, Floor, Zone, Subzone…). Afterwards you will be able to view each item’s location.

![ubicacion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/ubicacion.jpg)
![ubicacion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/ubicacion2.jpg)

- From the **enSITE** app you can also search by item and see all locations where that item exists, then move or decrement items as needed.

    ![ver_ubicacion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/ver_ubicacion.jpg)
    ![mover_salida](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/mover_salida.jpg)

> **If materials are damaged or there are other incidents**, you can attach documents or photos to the delivery note. These can then be reviewed from ENBLAU.

### 2.2 Receiving in ENBLAU

- In ENBLAU, once the purchase order is created you can generate a delivery note to record receipt of materials for that order.

- From the delivery note you can indicate the received quantity for each material. By default, the lines will be marked with the order quantity.

- Then set the delivery note location in the delivery note’s warehouse tab.

> **Note:** For more detailed information about receiving materials in ENBLAU, see: [4.2. Material reception](1.PR_Ventas_Compras.md#42-recepcion-de-material)

## 3. Production and enCONTROL

### 3.1 Production

- Create production projects in ENBLAU based on customer orders.
  - Create production.

    ![crear_produccion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/crear_produccion.jpg)

  - The next step is **Send to production**.

    ![enviar_produccion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/enviar_produccion.jpg)
    

  - In production you can view items under **Stock needed**, see which materials have been decremented and decrement items manually if required.

    ![stock_necesario](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/stock_necesario.jpg)
    ![stock_necesario](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/stock_necesario2.jpg)

> **Note:** For more information about creating production phases in ENBLAU, see: [3.5. Production](1.PR_Ventas_Compras.md#35-produccion)

### 3.2 enCONTROL

- Open **enCONTROL**. Production projects will appear. Administrators see all projects; other users see only assigned projects.

- Open the **Control monitor**. You can open it by double‑clicking any filter (in the header) or by double‑clicking a project and selecting the **Control** workstation if it is configured on the workstation.

    ![puesto_control](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/control.jpg)

    ![puesto_control](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/puesto_control.jpg)

- When a project is sent to production (Workshop), it is placed in the production queue on the **Production Management** tab. The production manager decides priority.

    ![gestion_produccion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/gestion_produccion.jpg)

- To remove an item from "Queued", drag it to the "In production" panel and a **Task** window will open to propose a date, set status, classification, etc.

    ![cola](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/cola.jpg)

    ![tarea](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/tarea.jpg)

- In the Planning tab you assign projects by dragging them to each responsible person. Select the responsible person and drag the project (you can select multiple responsibles with Ctrl + right‑click). You can also change priority left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

  ![planificacion_produccion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/planificacion_produccion.jpg)

  To unassign a project, select the responsible person, select the project and press Ctrl + Delete.

- The Production Calendar displays a Gantt chart based on Logikal times (in the example) showing production start and end dates.

  ![calendario_produccion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/calendario_produccion.jpg)

- Optimize processes according to production areas (cutting, machining, assembly, etc.). From the main project view, double‑clicking a project opens a Select Workstation window. Workstations are defined per client and visible per user.

  ![seleccion_puesto](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/seleccion_puesto.jpg)

- When entering any workstation the screen shows a **Start** button:

  ![iniciar](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/iniciar.jpg)

  Timing counts from start until pause or finish.

- Common fields across screens:
    - Comment — You can add a comment and select severity from a dropdown. The last valid comment is the one that unlocks.

      ![comentario](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/comentario.jpg)

      ![comentario](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/comentario2.jpg)

    - Pause — Pausing work requires selecting a reason from the list. You can then resume by selecting the same workstation again.

      ![pausar](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/pausar.jpg)

    - Finish — Finish when the work at that station is complete. You can later resume by starting the same workstation again.

      ![finalizar](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/finalizar.jpg)

    - Documentation — From Documentation you can view production documents exported from Logikal in the document viewer. You can also add a generic path to include catalogs, manuals, etc.

      ![documentacion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/documentacion.jpg)

#### 3.2.1 Workstations

**1. Material preparation**

  - Ready — Marks materials with a green check to indicate preparation is complete.
  - Not ready — Marks materials with a red X indicating they are not prepared.
  - Material location — If configured in enCONTROL, you can indicate where materials should be located so that decrements only occur from that location.

      ![preparacion](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/preparacion.jpg)

**2. Cutting**

  - In Cutting, indicate the bar length and waste. A cut‑offs window opens and you can adjust lengths as needed.

    ![corte](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/corte.jpg)

    ![desperdicio](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/desperdicio.jpg)

  - ENBLAU **Movements** will then reflect an exit for the total bar length (e.g., 6500) and an entry for the remaining piece (e.g., 4100) as recorded in the Cutting workstation.

    ![movimientos barra](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/movimientos_barra.jpg)

  - In the **Cut pieces** section the right side of the monitor shows a list of cuts made and you can print labels for each bar.

    ![cortados](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/cortados.jpg)
