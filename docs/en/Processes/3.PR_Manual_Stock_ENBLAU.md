# ENBLAU Stock Control System

---

## 1. Purpose

This manual is intended for new users of the stock control system used by Endades and our Customers. Its main goal is to provide a step-by-step guide for managing projects efficiently — from creating orders to optimizing production workflows in ENBLAU. The document covers the key operations and is organized sequentially to make it easy to follow.

---

## 2. Purchase order management

### 2.1 Purchase orders

- From the main menu go to **Purchasing** and open the "Purchase Orders" section.
- Specify the materials and the required quantities.
- If references change, add them manually provided they are configured in the database.
- From a sales order (under **Sales**) select the document and open the **Material needed** tab to generate the material list for that order.

    - Lines shown in <span style="color:green;">green</span> indicate the material is available in stock for that project or for the project configured as **Stock**. Lines shown in <span style="color:red;">red</span> indicate material is not available for that project or in stock.

    - You can choose whether to purchase each item (for example, if you already have it in the warehouse). For each material the system shows: units in stock, reserved units, and outstanding units.

    ![material_necesario](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/material_necesario.jpg)

  > ⚠️ Important: To assign a project as the stock project, go to General → Configuration → **Purchasing and Warehouse**, and set the **Project for stock** dropdown to a previously created project used for stock management.

  ![material_necesario](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/proyecto_stock.jpg)

- Confirm with **Request material** and send the order to the corresponding supplier.

- In **Warehouses** there is an option called **Pending to receive** which shows a list of materials pending receipt by project and purchase order.

  ![pendientes_recibir](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/pendiente_recibir.jpg)

- Right-clicking a material line lets you open the purchase order for that item:

  ![pendientes_recibir](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/pendiente_recibir2.jpg)

> ℹ️ Note: For more detailed information about purchase orders see: [Purchase Orders](1.PR_Ventas_Compras.md#4-compras)

> ⚠️ Important: Creating material requests from a sales document may require special permissions in some cases. This permission can also be required for manufacturing or installation operations.

![Permisos especiales](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/permisos_especiales.jpg)

### 2.2 Assigning materials to a project

- From the Material needed view you can reassign items from another project to the current project. Right-click the line in the locations section and choose **Assign**:

  ![Asignar articulos](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/asignar.jpg)

  - Select the destination project (defaults to the current project) and the quantity (defaults to the quantity required):
  
  ![Asignar articulos](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/asignar2.jpg)

  - When an item is assigned to the destination project, the stock units are transferred: the destination project’s stock increases by the assigned quantity and the origin project’s stock decreases. The item will be shown in green.

> ⚠️ Important: Ensure materials are allowed to be used from the project you are transferring from.

### 2.3 Reserved materials

- You can reserve materials for a project from **Sales**, **Purchasing**, or **Projects** by selecting **Reserved materials** and choosing the warehouse from the dropdown.

  ![material_reservado](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/material_reservado.jpg)

- A Reserved Material window opens and from **Project materials** you can drag items from supplier orders:

  ![material_reservado](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/material_reservado_2.jpg)

- The Warehouses area shows all reserved materials for a project:

  ![material_reservado](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/material_reservado_3.jpg)

  ![material_reservado](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/material_reservado_4.jpg)

> ℹ️ Note: Reserving material is primarily visual and does not prevent usage of the items. For stricter control use [Assigning materials to a project](#22-assigning-materials-to-a-project).

### 2.4 Stock replenishment

 In **Purchasing** there is a **Stock replenishment** option in the warehouse dropdown that lists materials below minimum or below typical stock levels.

  ![reposicion_stock](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/reposicion_stock.jpg)
    
 - Materials marked in **red** are below the **minimum** or below the **typical** threshold.

    - **Units in stock** shows the quantity currently available.  
    - **Units to order** indicates how many units are needed to reach the configured maximum stock.  
    - Materials that meet the minimum or typical level **do not appear** in the replenishment list.

 - Materials marked in **green** are those without a defined maximum stock.

    - By default, one unit is considered for items configured as below minimum or below typical so they show up in the replenishment list.

 - Check the **To import** box for materials you want to include, then click **Import** to add them to a purchase order.

  ![reposicion_stock](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/reposicion_stock2.jpg)

> ℹ️ Note: To learn how to define minimum, maximum and typical stock values for a material, see [Material configuration](#51-material-configuration).

    ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios2.jpg)

### 4.2 Stock counting and reconciliation

  1. From an inventory, select the **Project** defined as **Stock**.  

  2. Click **Get stock** to load the list of materials for the Stock project:  
    ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios3.jpg)
    ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios4.jpg)  

  3. In the **Counted units** column enter the actual counted quantity for the item at the warehouse location.  
    ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios5.jpg)  

  4. After entering counted units, item lines that changed will appear in red. Click **Update warehouse** to apply the reconciliation based on counted units.  
    ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios6.jpg)  

  5. After updating the warehouse, the lines will appear in green.

  - The **Stock units** and **Counted units** columns will reflect the updated values.  
  - The **Counted** column will display a checkbox.  
  - The **Counted date** column will show the reconciliation date.  

      ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios7.jpg)    

  - This process generates a reconciliation movement (entry or exit) in the warehouse:  

    ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios13.jpg)  

    > ℹ️ Note: The inventory list only shows **entries** and **exits**. Transfer movements cannot be performed from this listing.

  6. You can also add new items from the trees:

  - **Items (ENBLAU materials)**
  - **Imported items (Logikal materials)**

    To add an item:
    - Drag the item into the inventory list.
    - Specify **units**, **dimensions** (if applicable: bar, surface, joint), **stock location**, and **price**.  
      ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios8.jpg)  

    > ℹ️ Note: When adding a new item to the inventory you must always specify a **location**, otherwise it will not update stock.

  7. Use **Refresh stock units** to update the current units for each inventory line.  

   ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios9.jpg)

### 4.3 Inventory reconciliation report

- You can **Print** the inventory listing which shows columns: Item, Description, Last check date, Units in stock, Counted units and Location.  

  ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios10.jpg)

  ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios11.jpg)  

- This report helps with manual stock counting before updating the inventory listing. The **Counted units** column should contain the real quantity counted for each item.  

  ![Inventarios](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/inventarios12.jpg)  

## 5. Required stock (Stock needed)

- After creating production and sending items to the workshop, you can view and decrement materials manually.

  ![Listado informes](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/stock_necesario.jpg)

- A Stock needed window shows which warehouses contain the material and which workstation (monitor) will have the material decremented. To decrement material, check the box in the **Stock to decrement** column for the item.

  ![Listado informes](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/stock_necesario2.jpg)

> ⚠️ Important: If the material is not in stock it will not be decremented.

> ℹ️ Note: For more precise stock control we recommend using the mobile app enSITE to perform material decrements. For more information about the app see [2.1 Receiving in enSITE](4.PR_Manual_Stock_enCONTROL.md#21-recepcion-en-ensite)
  
---

## 6. Imported materials

The **Warehouses → Imported materials** section lists all materials imported from **Logikal**.

---

### 6.1 Material configuration

From this section you can define default settings for each item that affect purchasing and production:

- **Buy**: If checked, the material will be proposed by default as "to buy" when listed from **Material needed**.

- **Assembled at destination**: If checked, the material will be assembled at destination during the Picking step in **enCONTROL**.

- **Stock control**: If enabled, the material will be considered for automatic decrement during production.

- **Minimum stock**, **maximum stock**, and **typical stock**: Define reference values useful for alerts, replenishment and planning.

    ![Material importado](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/material_importado.jpg)

    In the [Stock replenishment](#24-stock-replenishment) section you can generate a list of items below minimum or below typical levels according to the configured values for each material.

> ℹ️ Note: Properly configuring these fields significantly improves inventory control, purchase planning and material traceability during production.

---

## 7. Finished product

The **finished product** is an item that has been fully manufactured and passed through the **Final inspection** workstation in **enCONTROL**.

Under **Warehouses → Finished product** there are two main listings:

- **Product locations**
- **Product movements**

  ![Material importado](Imagenes/PR_Stock_Control/producto_terminado.jpg)

---

### 7.1 Product locations
