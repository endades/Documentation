# Creating and editing custom reports

---

## 1. Introduction
This guide explains how to create and modify report templates by cloning and editing existing reports â€” without needing to build a template from scratch. The workflow is designed to be simple and avoid confusion, allowing users to adapt reports efficiently to their needs.

## 2. Creating a custom report
To create a report based on an existing one, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the base report**:  
    - Navigate to the report you want to use as the basis for your new custom report.    

2. **Create a copy of the report**:  
    - Choose the option to create a new report from the existing one. This creates an exact copy of the original report that you can modify without affecting the base report.

## 3. Editing the report
After creating a copy of the report, personalize it as follows:

1. **Open the newly created report**:  
    - Access the report you just copied.

2. **Open edit mode**:  
    - Select the edit option to start making changes.

3. **Make the required changes**:  
    - Modify fields, sections or data as needed. You can add, remove or adjust information according to your requirements. Use the available editing tools to update the template:

4. **Save the report**:  
   - Once changes are complete, save the document to finish editing.

## 4. Removing extra elements
If the report requires deeper modifications you can remove sections or unnecessary data before saving the final version. To do this:

1. **Identify unnecessary elements**:  
   - Review the report and determine which sections or data are not relevant to your purpose.

2. **Remove elements**:  
   - Use the delete option to remove elements you don't need.

    - For some reports (for example a Delivery Note) you may need to remove part of a script. Open the Script section:

    - If the unwanted lines are present in the script, delete them:

    - Return to the Designer section:

3. **Save your changes**:  
   - Make sure to save the report after performing deletions.

## 6. Using the new template
Once the new report is created, select it and go to **Preview**:
