## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide basic knowledge on how **enCLAD** works, to streamline the management of processes in building cladding.

Before starting to work with enCLAD, it is necessary to have a database with the systems and materials defined in **enMATERIALS**.

## 2. Specific Nomenclatures of enCLAD

### 2.1. Master Line
Rails used for drawing building footprints or intermediate studs.

- **Cut lines**: red, continuous
- **Reinforcement lines**: black, discontinuous

  ![enCLAD](Imagenes/UT_enCLAD/enclad3.png)

### 2.2. Cladding Frame
Area located between lines.

- **Green**: areas to be clad
- **Red**: non-clad areas
- **Clad Property**: `Yes / No`

  Used for automatic panel calculation from the **Design and calculation** button.

### 4.3. Delete cladding
The **Delete cladding** dropdown offers different possibilities. Delete parts of a cladding, or the entire cladding.

Options:

- **Lines:** Gives us the possibility to delete the cladding lines from our design. Deleting cladding lines implies the deletion of materials that depend on this line, such as studs or anchors.
- **Frames:** Deleting cladding frames does not delete any material. These frames are only the defined areas that will be panelized during panel calculation. Once the panels are created, we will not need them and can delete them.
- **Openings:** Deletes openings from the cladding surface. If we already have the necessary panels, it is not necessary to have the cladding openings.
- **Panels:** Deletes panels from the project.
- **Complete cladding:** Deletes the cladding from the selected wall(s), or from all walls otherwise. Cladding surface and its openings, cladding lines, cladding frames, panels, studs, anchors, ...

## 7. Cladding

### 7.1. Automation

#### 7.1.1. Design and calculation

Automation of building cladding calculation. Using the design and calculation wizard we can automatically obtain the necessary cladding for the walls we have selected at that moment, or for all walls in the building otherwise.

  ![enCLAD](Imagenes/UT_enCLAD/enclad23.png)

  - Lines imported from the CAD file will be drawn, and a cladding surface will be created if necessary.

  ![enCLAD](Imagenes/UT_enCLAD/enclad23.png)

  - Imported modulation.

  ![enCLAD](Imagenes/UT_enCLAD/enclad24.png)

##### 7.1.2. Quick design
Quick design allows us to obtain a calculation of the building's modulation, to obtain an initial approval from the architect / client involved.

  ![enCLAD](Imagenes/UT_enCLAD/enclad25.png)

Options:

- **Initialize surface:** Initializes a cladding surface, at the indicated distance according to the indicated facade offset. This offset will be to the visible face of the panel.
- **Initialize lines:** Initializes the horizontal and vertical footprints that will define our model. In quick design, only the footprints (cut lines) are calculated.
  Lines can be cut or reinforcement. Cut lines will define the model's footprints, reinforcement lines will define the intermediate studs. The lines will be calculated based on the openings and the dimensions of the chosen panels.
- **Initialize frames:** Frames will be calculated based on the cladding lines, and will be the spaces defined between them.
- **Initialize panels:** Panels will be calculated for each of the design frames, provided we have not set any of the frames as 'Do not clad'. It will take into account the openings or architraves that are inside them. As it is a quick design, this panel calculation will not consider wings or machining. It will only show us a front view of the calculated modulation.

> **Note:** Does not include wings or machining.

##### 7.1.3. Complete calculation
The complete calculation will provide us with both the modulation, and the actual calculation of panels and all the necessary substructure to carry out our project. The checks we find to manage differ from the quick design checks.

  ![enCLAD](Imagenes/UT_enCLAD/enclad26.png)

Includes:

- **Initialize panels:** They will be calculated in the same way as in the quick design, but by calculating them completely, it will provide us with the necessary wings and other information to send for cutting.
- **Calculate reinforcements:** Calculates the necessary reinforcements between footprints.
- **Calculate profiles:** Draws the necessary profiles.
- **Calculate anchors:** Draws the necessary anchors.
